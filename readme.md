**Abstract:** Advancements in virtual and head-mounted devices
have introduced new challenges for iris biometrics, such
as varying gaze directions, partial occlusions, and incon-
sistent lighting conditions. To address these obstacles, we
present VREyeSAM, a robust iris segmentation framework
specifically designed for images captured under both
steady and dynamic gaze scenarios. Our pipeline includes
a quality-aware pre-processing module that automatically
filters out partially or fully closed eyes, ensuring that only
high-quality, fully open iris images are used for training
and inference. In addition, we introduce an uncertainty-
weighted hybrid loss function that adaptively balances
multiple learning objectives, enhancing the robustness of
the model under diverse visual conditions. Evaluated on
the VRBiom dataset, VREyeSAM delivers state-of-the-art
performance, achieving a Precision of 0.751, Recall of
0.870, F1-Score of 0.806, and a mean IoU of 0.647 out-
performing existing segmentation methods by a significant
margin
